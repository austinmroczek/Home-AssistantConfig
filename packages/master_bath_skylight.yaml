# Per email with Fakro support on 12/3/19
# If the window is closed, it always reports Value 0, even if it is raining
# If the window is open
#   Value 0 - occurs only after the first answer since the power reset - when the rain sensor does not detect
#   Value 1 - reports when the sensor is active (rain detection occurs)
#   Value 254 - reports when the sensor is not detecting rain at a given moment - i.e. when it is not raining
